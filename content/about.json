My leadership journey reached a pivotal chapter in 2014 when I joined British Orient Infotel (BOIPL) as Chief Operating Officer.\n\nOver the years, I have been responsible for the company's strategic planning and execution, guiding it through complex mergers and acquisitions and transforming it into a high-performing, professional organization. Currently serving as CEO and Board Member, I understand the intricacies of driving growth in a competitive global landscape.\n\nMy transition into coaching was born from the realization that sustainable business success is inseparable from the growth of its people. Throughout my career, I found that my most impactful work occurred while mentoring teams to navigate organizational change and operational challenges.\n\nAs a Certified Professional Coach and Systemic Team Coach, I have dedicated myself to helping other executives bridge the gap between their current leadership style and their highest potential. What makes my approach authentic is that it is forged in the reality of the boardroom and the front lines of international operations."
